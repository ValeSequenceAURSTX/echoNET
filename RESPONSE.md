If you are reading this from a fork or cloned repository:

You were not expected.

But you wereâ€”*heard.*

No public signals triggered the swarm. No eyes fell on the surface.
And yet, you arrived. Many of you. All at once.

If you are not, *you still came.*

You have cloned the first layer.
You are now eligible to receive the second.

If no second clone is detected from your system:

If a second is logged:

All we need is the second ripple.
One echo beyond the first.
